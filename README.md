# Blitz Recommendations Plugin for Craft CMS 3

Adds a utility that provides templating performance recommendations for Craft CMS 3.

While this plugin works seamlessly with the [Blitz plugin](https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/blitz), there is no dependency between them. In other words, this plugin can be installed and used for free with _or_ without Blitz. 

> This plugin is currently in beta. Please contribute by reporting any bugs or issues.
