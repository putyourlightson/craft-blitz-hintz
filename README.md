# Blitz Recommendations Plugin for Craft CMS

Adds a utility that provides templating performance hints for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

While this plugin works seamlessly with the [Blitz](https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/blitz) plugin, there is no dependency on it. In other words, this plugin can be installed and used independently and for free _without_ Blitz.
