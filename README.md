# Blitz Recommendations Plugin

Adds a utility that provides templating performance recommendations for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

While this plugin works seamlessly with the [Blitz plugin](https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/blitz), there is no dependency between them. In other words, this plugin can be installed and used for free with _or_ without Blitz.
